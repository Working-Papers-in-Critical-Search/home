## What We Publish

**Working Papers in Critical Search** is a flexible venue for computational history. We publish:

- **Draft papers** on their way to traditional journals
- **Dataset papers** documenting historical data you've created
- **Method notes** on tools, pipelines, or techniques
- **Short pieces** that don't fit traditional formats

The common thread: **showing your work**. Include your code, describe your methods, and be transparent about what you did.

We focus on **critical search**: the intersection of historical inquiry and computational methods—NLP, machine learning, LLMs, database design, and information retrieval applied to historical sources.

## Why Here?

Traditional venues have constraints: word limits, format requirements, long timelines. We offer:

1. **Flexibility** — Full papers, dataset notes, method sketches, whatever fits your work
2. **Speed** — Publish in weeks, not months
3. **Transparency** — Show your code, describe your methods honestly
4. **Iteration** — Update your work as it develops; freeze versions for citation when ready
