## Mission

**Working Papers in Critical Search** is a flexible venue for historians doing computational work. We publish things that don't fit neatly into traditional journals:

- Draft papers you're developing for eventual journal submission
- Dataset papers documenting collections you've built
- Method notes on pipelines, tools, or techniques
- Short pieces that are too small for a journal but too important to lose

We believe that historical methodology should be transparent and open to revision. Show your work.

## What is "Critical Search"?

Critical search examines how we find, filter, and interpret historical evidence using computational tools. This includes:

- **Natural Language Processing** applied to historical corpora
- **Machine learning** for document classification, OCR correction, or entity extraction
- **Large language models** for transcription, summarization, and information extraction from historical sources
- **Geospatial methods** including historical GIS, georeferencing, and spatial analysis
- **Linked open data** and interoperable knowledge graphs
- **Database design** and querying strategies for historical data
- **Information retrieval** experiments on digitized archives
- **Critical analysis** of search algorithms, AI systems, and their biases

New methods are emerging rapidly—multimodal LLMs that can read handwritten documents, vision models that extract structure from historical maps, georeferencing pipelines that place sources in space, embedding models that find semantic connections across millions of pages. We want a place to document what works, what doesn't, and what historians should know about these tools.

## Editorial Philosophy

### Living Documents

Papers published here are not frozen. Authors may update their work as:

- Code libraries release new versions
- New data sources become available
- Readers identify errors or suggest improvements

Each significant update receives a new version number (v1.1, v1.2, etc.) and a new Zenodo DOI.

### Show Your Work

We ask that you include your code and describe your methods. This doesn't mean everything needs to be instantly reproducible on a laptop - if your analysis required an HPC cluster and weeks of compute, just say so. The point is transparency, not perfection.

### Editorial Gatekeeping (Not Peer Review)

We use editorial review rather than formal peer review:

- **Speed**: Papers can be published within weeks, not months
- **Quality**: Editors verify the argument and check that code runs
- **Iteration**: Substantial revisions happen post-publication, in the open

Papers that pass editorial review and have verified reproducible code receive a **Reproducible** badge.
