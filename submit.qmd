## What We're Looking For

We're a flexible venue. You might submit:

- **A draft paper** — Something you're developing for a traditional journal. Get feedback, establish priority, iterate in public.
- **A dataset paper** — You built a historical dataset. Document it, share it, get credit for it.
- **A method note** — You figured out how to do something useful. Write it up so others can learn.
- **A short piece** — An observation, a benchmark, a comparison. Too small for a journal but worth sharing.

Topics include but are not limited to:

- **Natural Language Processing** applied to historical corpora
- **Machine learning** for document classification, OCR correction, or entity extraction
- **Large language models** for transcription, summarization, and information extraction from historical sources
- **Geospatial methods** including historical GIS, georeferencing, and spatial analysis
- **Linked open data** and interoperable knowledge graphs
- **Database design** and querying strategies for historical data
- **Information retrieval** experiments on digitized archives
- **Critical analysis** of search algorithms, AI systems, and their biases

## How to Submit

### Step 1: Create Your Paper Repo

1. Go to our [paper template](https://github.com/Working-Papers-in-Critical-Search/paper-template)
2. Click **"Use this template"** → **"Create a new repository"**
3. Create it in **your own GitHub account** (not the org)
4. Name it something like `paper-your-short-title`

### Step 2: Write Your Paper

Clone your repo and edit `index.qmd`. Structure it however makes sense for your work.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/paper-your-title.git
cd paper-your-title
# edit index.qmd
quarto preview  # see it locally
```

Include your code. If your analysis requires serious compute (HPC cluster, days of runtime), just say so honestly. The point is showing your work, not pretending everything runs on a laptop.

### Step 3: Transfer to the Organization

When you're ready for editorial review:

1. Go to your repo's **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Danger Zone**
3. Click **Transfer ownership**
4. Transfer to: `Working-Papers-in-Critical-Search`

Your full commit history, issues, and everything else comes with it.

### Step 4: Editorial Review

We'll review your submission:

- Does it fit our scope?
- Is the code/method documented enough to understand?
- Any obvious issues?

We may request changes via pull request. This is gatekeeping, not formal peer review — we're checking for fit and clarity, not sending it to three anonymous reviewers.

### Step 5: Publication

Once accepted:

1. We merge any final changes
2. We create a **GitHub Release** (e.g., `v1.0`)
3. **Zenodo automatically archives it and mints a DOI**
4. Your paper appears on the main site

## What We Need From You

### Show Your Work

Include your code or describe your methods. This doesn't mean it has to run on a reviewer's laptop — if you needed an HPC cluster with H100s and 30 hours of compute time, just tell us that. The point is transparency.

### Data

- **Small data** (< 10MB): Include it in the `data/` folder
- **Large data**: Host on Zenodo, Hugging Face, or another repository with a DOI. Link to it in your paper.
- **Sensitive data**: Describe what you used and how others might access similar sources

### Honest Compute Requirements

We welcome work at any scale:

- **Laptop-scale**: Runs anywhere
- **Server-scale**: Needs a GPU, takes hours
- **Cluster-scale**: Needs HPC, takes days

Just be clear about what you used.

## After Publication

### Updates

Your paper is a living document. Submit a pull request to update it anytime. Minor fixes (typos, broken links) get merged quickly. Major revisions may warrant a new version number.

### New Versions

When you want to create a citable new version:

1. Submit updates via PR
2. We create a new release (`v1.1`, `v2.0`, etc.)
3. Zenodo mints a new DOI for that version

Previous versions remain citable at their original DOIs.

### arXiv (Optional)

If your paper has strong technical contributions, we can help submit a PDF snapshot to arXiv.

## Not a Git User?

Email us your materials and we'll handle the technical setup:

- Your notebook (`.qmd`, `.ipynb`, `.Rmd`, or even Word + code files)
- Any small data files
- Author info (name, affiliation, ORCID if you have one)
