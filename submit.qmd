## What We're Looking For

We're a flexible venue. You might submit:

- **A draft paper** — Something you're developing for a traditional journal. Get feedback, establish priority, iterate in public.
- **A dataset paper** — You built a historical dataset. Document it, share it, get credit for it.
- **A method note** — You figured out how to do something useful. Write it up so others can learn.
- **A short piece** — An observation, a benchmark, a comparison. Too small for a journal but worth sharing.

Topics include but are not limited to:

- NLP analysis of historical corpora
- Machine learning for historical document processing
- OCR pipelines and document digitization
- Database design for historical research
- Critical analysis of search and retrieval methods
- Benchmarking AI tools on historical sources

## What We Need

### Code That Shows Your Work

Every submission should include the code you used. This doesn't mean it has to run on a reviewer's laptop - if you needed an HPC cluster with H100s and 30 hours of compute time, just tell us that. The point is transparency about methods, not enforcing that everything be instantly reproducible.

### Supported Formats

- **Quarto** (`.qmd`) — Preferred
- **Jupyter Notebook** (`.ipynb`) — We'll convert to Quarto
- **R Markdown** (`.Rmd`) — We'll convert to Quarto
- **Scripts + writeup** — We can work with this too

### Data

- **Small data** (< 10 MB): Include it in your submission
- **Large data**: Host on Zenodo, Hugging Face, or another repository with a DOI. Link to it in your paper.
- **Sensitive data**: Describe what you used and how others might access similar sources

### Computational Scale

We welcome work at any scale:

- **Laptop-scale**: Runs anywhere, great for teaching
- **Server-scale**: Needs a decent GPU, takes hours
- **Cluster-scale**: Needs HPC, takes days

Just be honest about what you used. If readers need an H100 and a week of compute to reproduce your work, say so clearly.

## How to Submit

### Option 1: Email (Easiest)

Send your notebook and any small data files to: *[TBD]*

We'll handle the conversion and GitHub setup.

### Option 2: Pull Request (For Git Users)

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new folder: `papers/NNN-your-short-title/`
3. Add your files following the [template structure](#paper-structure)
4. Submit a Pull Request

## Paper Structure {#paper-structure}

```
papers/NNN-short-title/
├── index.qmd          # The main paper (required)
├── _metadata.yml      # Paper metadata (required)
├── data/              # Small datasets (< 10MB total)
├── figures/           # Generated figures (optional)
├── scripts/           # Helper scripts (optional)
└── README.md          # Brief description
```

### Required Metadata (`_metadata.yml`)

```yaml
title: "Your Paper Title"
author:
  - name: "Author Name"
    affiliation: "Institution"
    orcid: "0000-0000-0000-0000"
date: "2025-01-15"
version: "1.0"
keywords:
  - keyword1
  - keyword2
abstract: |
  A brief abstract describing the paper's contribution.
```

## Review Process

1. **Initial Check** (1 week): Editors verify the submission is complete and in scope
2. **Technical Review** (1-2 weeks): Does the code run? Is it documented?
3. **Editorial Review** (1-2 weeks): Does the argument hold? Is it "critical"?
4. **Publication**: Merge to main, website updates immediately

### Badges

- **Reproducible** — Code runs without errors on a clean environment
- **Reviewed** — Passed editorial gatekeeping

## After Publication

### Updates Welcome

You can update your paper at any time via Pull Request. Minor updates (typos, dependency fixes) increment the patch version (v1.0 → v1.0.1). Major revisions increment the minor version (v1.0 → v1.1).

### Zenodo Archiving

When you're ready to "freeze" a version for citation, we create a GitHub Release. Zenodo automatically archives it and mints a DOI.

### arXiv Submission (Optional)

If your paper has strong technical contributions, we can help submit a PDF snapshot to arXiv (categories: cs.CL, cs.CY, cs.DL).

### Hugging Face (Optional)

If your paper produces a reusable dataset or model, we can help create a Hugging Face card.
