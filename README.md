**A home for history that shows its work.**

Working Papers in Critical Search publishes computational history research as executable notebooks. Every paper includes reproducible code, enabling readers to verify, replicate, and build upon the work.

## What is Critical Search?

Critical search examines how we find, filter, and interpret historical evidence using computational tools:

- Natural Language Processing on historical corpora
- Machine learning for document processing
- Database design and querying strategies
- Critical analysis of search algorithms and their biases

## For Authors

We welcome submissions from historians using computational methods. See our [submission guidelines](https://working-papers-in-critical-search.github.io/home/submit.html).

### Quick Start

1. Fork this repository
2. Copy `papers/_template/` to `papers/NNN-your-title/`
3. Write your paper as a Quarto notebook
4. Submit a Pull Request

### Requirements

- **Code is mandatory** — The notebook is the paper
- **Data < 10MB** — Commit to repo; larger datasets go to Zenodo
- **Reproducibility** — Code should run in a clean environment

## For Readers

Each paper includes:

- **HTML version** — Read online with interactive code blocks
- **PDF version** — Download for offline reading
