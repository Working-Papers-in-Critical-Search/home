## How Papers Are Numbered

Papers are numbered sequentially: 001, 002, 003, etc. The number never changes, even if the paper is updated.

Version numbers (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0) track revisions:

- **Patch** (v1.0.1): Typo fixes, dependency updates
- **Minor** (v1.1): New analysis, additional data, improved visualizations
- **Major** (v2.0): Substantial rewrite, new conclusions
