Each paper lives in its own repository with its own DOI.

## How It Works

Each paper is a separate GitHub repository under our organization. When a paper is ready, we tag a release and Zenodo automatically mints a DOI.

Papers can be updated anytime. New releases get new DOIs. Old versions remain citable.
